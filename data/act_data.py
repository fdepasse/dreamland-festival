It landed on top of both the U.K. and U.S. rock album charts and took home the Mercury Prize. What set the group apart was , a singer/songwriter with a biting wit and grasp of English vernacular (not dissimilar to , the godfather of modern British rock). However, driven by their maverick creative spirit, Arctic Monkeys have proven highly unpredictable, reworking classic rock traditions on 2007's Favourite Worst Nightmare and beefing up their guitars with the assistance of 's  on 2009's Humbug. Eventually, they also laced in some of the louche lounge aspects of 's swinging side project , as on 2013's AM and 2018's arty Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, but by that point, the band were a staple throughout the world: a respected, adventurous, and successful group who could easily be called Britain's biggest band of the early 21st century."),

Communal life and a slew of shared influences produced an electronic, rock-oriented sound that harked back to the Madchester days of baggy pants and druggy dancing. Releasing their eponymous debut in 2004, Kasabian expanded that sound on later albums, but the band's foundation remained rooted in fragmented dance textures and boisterous rock & roll. The approach was well-received; the group went to the top of the U.K. album chart for the first time with 2006's Empire, and their sixth album, For Crying Out Loud, became their fifth straight number one when it arrived in 2017."),

Jack and Meg White's clever use of limitations from their lineup to their instrumentation to their red, white, and black color scheme maximized their creativity, allowing them to bring a surprising number of facets to their seemingly back-to-basics approach. Meg's straight-ahead, minimalist drumming complemented Jack's freewheeling guitars and vocals perfectly, and their music touched on not only on obvious forebears such as the Gories and the Stooges, but also Son House and Blind Willie McTell's mythic blues, Led Zeppelin's riffs, the Gun Club's unhinged punk, and the timeless storytelling of country and folk legends such as Loretta Lynn and Bob Dylan."),
